PROJ-125,"Database optimization","The database queries are running slow, especially on the user dashboard. We need to optimize the following queries:

1. User activity history
2. Dashboard statistics
3. Report generation

Consider adding indexes for frequently accessed columns and reviewing the join operations in complex queries.","John Doe",2023-01-18T14:22:00.000Z

PROJ-129,"Add export to CSV feature","Users need to be able to export their data to CSV format. This should be available on the reports page and should include options for selecting date ranges and data categories.

Technical details:
- Use a streaming approach for large datasets
- Include proper header formatting
- Handle special characters and escaping
- Add progress indicator for large exports","John Doe",2023-01-28T13:45:00.000Z
PROJ-130,"Improve error handling","Improve error handling throughout the application","Alex Johnson",2023-02-01T10:20:00.000Z
PROJ-131,"Performance optimization for image gallery","The image gallery is loading slowly for users with many images. Implement the following optimizations:

1. Lazy loading for images not in the viewport
2. Image compression and responsive sizes
3. Pagination or infinite scrolling instead of loading all at once
4. Preloading of adjacent images

Also consider using a CDN for faster image delivery and caching.","Jane Smith",2023-02-05T09:30:00.000Z

1. Authentication endpoints (login, logout, refresh token)
2. User management endpoints (create, update, delete)
3. Data CRUD operations
4. Error handling and edge cases

Use Jest and Supertest for the testing framework.","Alex Johnson",2023-02-15T11:20:00.000Z

PROJ-135,"Implement API rate limiting","Add rate limiting to our API endpoints to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. Implementation should:

- Use token bucket algorithm
- Apply different limits for authenticated vs unauthenticated users
- Include rate limit headers in responses
- Log excessive usage attempts
- Provide clear error messages when limits are exceeded

This will help improve overall system stability and security.","John Doe",2023-02-22T09:10:00.000Z

1. Switching to incremental backups on weekdays
2. Performing full backups only on weekends
3. Compressing backup files before transferring to storage
4. Scheduling backups during low-traffic periods
5. Implementing parallel processing for large tables

Also add monitoring to ensure backups complete successfully and implement alerting for any failures.","John Doe",2023-03-01T10:15:00.000Z
